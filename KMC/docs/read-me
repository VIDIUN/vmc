Example for working with xampp
********************************
You can point your virtual host to your vmc workspace. In this case you can leave your output folder
to be in bin-debug (no special configuration required).

Point your xampp to your vmc workspace in the following manner:
1. build your workspace under: C:\workspaces\vmc
2. go to: C:\xampp\apache\conf\extra\
3. open httpd-vhosts.conf
4. add to the file:
	<VirtualHost *:80>
	    ServerAdmin postmaster@dummy-host2.localhost
	    DocumentRoot "C:/workspaces/"
	    ServerName workspace
	    ErrorLog "logs/dummy-workspaces-error.log"
	    CustomLog "logs/dummy-workspaces-access.log" combined
	 	<Directory C:/workspaces>
		 	AllowOverride All
		 	order allow,deny
		 	allow from all
	 	</Directory>
	</VirtualHost>
